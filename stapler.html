							<h1>Stapler Redesign</h1>
							<h2>UX DESIGN | UC SAN DIEGO | NOVEMBER 2018 TO DECEMBER 2018</h2>
							<img width='100%' src="images/stapler/slide.png">
							<h1>Background</h1>
							<p>Tasked with redesigning an everyday thing (inspired by Don Norman), my team and I chose to focus on the stapler. </p>
							<p>The stapler is an everyday object that...</p>
							<h2><em>HASN’T BEEN REDESIGNED FOR OVER 50 YEARS!</em></h2>

							<li>A <b>potential safety hazard</b> in offices (Albert Einstein College of Medicine)</li>
							<li>Lifespan: <b>15.6 days</b> of daily use (Middle Tennessee State University)</li>
							<li>Broken staplers due to <b>jamming</b> (Middle Tennessee State University)</li>
							
							<br>
							<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
							<p>People who frequently use staplers for their job or school need a safe and reliable device to depend on so they don’t have to waste time when using a stapler and can instead focus on their work.</p>

							<br>
							<h1>Needfinding</h1>
							<p>We made a mind map to brainstorm different aspects of the product and develop an integrated stream of conscious on paper</p>
							<br>
							<figure>
								<img src="images/stapler/dmap.jpg" style="width:100%">
								<figcaption>Design Map examing who, why, where, price, and safety aspects of staplers.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<We>We interviewed at various locations around our school campus and our respective neighborhoods to avoid biases. We asked participants a series of pre-interview questions to see what their experience has been like with staplers in the past. We then asked them to perform an activity using the stapler which involved 5 different tasks.</p></p>
							<b>Tasks:</b>
							<br>
							<ol>
								<li>Open the entire stapler (turn stapler head backwards) & close it. </li>
								<li>Open the reload chamber/staples-holder.</li>
								<li>Refill staples: put new staples in and then take them out.</li>
								<li>Try to staple 15 sheets of paper.</li>
								<li>Change the mode of the stapler so that the staples are going outward rather than inward.</li>
							</ol>

											</figure>
											<p>There are two settings on the base plate for the direction in which the staple bends: inward and outward. According to stapler makers, that little-used groove is for the sniveling hordes who lack the decisiveness of your circle of friends. When your pals hook together a wad of papers, they mean business. They use the channel that double-bends the staple and clenches the points toward the middle and back into the wad itself. The other setting, the one that splays the staple points outward, is for temporarily attaching papers that are intended to be separated again. The attachment is looser, and it's easier to remove the staple without chewing up the corners of the pages.</p>

							<h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
							<p>While coming up with ideas on how to tackle the redesigning of the stapler, we sat down together as a group and discussed qualities of staplers we think are most important to examine, as well as which staplers we should look at. We used four main criteria to examine popular staplers in the competitive market:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Discoverability; how easy it was to find signifiers and affordances.</li>
								<li>Safety; how easy it would be to jam or break the product, as well as hurt oneself while using it</li>
								<li>User experience; measures how easily users can use and perform tasks with the product, not feeling ‘useless’ or ‘incompetent’ and or having the stapler jammed</li>
								<li>Lifespan; how long it is kept usable and functionable if used roughly everyday</li>
							</ol>

							</div>
							<p>From our competitive audit we learned:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Staplers on the market are dangerous and unsafe to use, which can be attributed to the large size and metal material of the stapler</li>
								<li>Lifespan of a product depends on the material it is made of, as different materials tend to remain held together for longer</li>
								<li>Looking at those the mini stapler and the Swingline stapler, who both exhibit lower discoverability and poor safety, we realized our redesign cannot be too large or heavy (with more potential for harm) or too small or light (with more potential for low discoverability).</li>
							</ol>
							
							<h1>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h1>
							<p>After analyzing the different trends and extrapolating problems from our data, we yielded a number of different ideas to implement in our prototypes.</p>
							<br>
							<h2>First Iteration:</h2>
							<figure>
								<img class='imgLarge' src='images/stapler/i1.jpg' style="width:100%">
								<figcaption>This design has two heads, one for the inward staples and the other for the outward.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<br>
							<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
							<dl>
								<dt>Distance from the rotational axis to where the force is applied on the stapler head is smaller than the traditional stapler’s, so people will need to put more force on the stapler for the same amount of papers they would in a traditional stapler</dt>
								<dd><ul><li>Thus, users will have to push harder than they would with a traditional stapler, which can be dangerous and cause more jamming.</li></ul></dd>
								<dt>To keep the concept of the double head we would have to make each head the same length as the current stapler. This would yield a very long stapler, meaning it would…</dt>
								<dd>
								<ul>
									<li>Take up too much space on a desk or a drawer</li>
									<li>Be less attractive in the eye of the consumer aesthetically and practically </li>
									<li>Be less portable</li>
								</ul>
								</dd>
								<p>Thus, we decided to try another redesign we had brainstormed.</p>
							</dl>

							<h2>Second Iteration:</h2>
							<figure>
								<img class='imgLarge' src='images/stapler/i2.jpg' style="width:100%">
								<figcaption>Focused and improved upon the design of the traditional-looking stapler. We added several buttons indicating where to press to activate different functions</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<br>
							<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
							<dl>
								<dt>A button to open the stapler head</dt>
								<dd>
								<ul>
									<li>to tackle on of the biggest problems we found in our interviews</li>
									<li>Conveniently located on both sides of the stapler at the rotational axis, to help users see where to press regardless of their location</li>									</li>
									<li>To put the stapler head back in its original position, the user simply needs to push it down.</li>
								</ul>
								</dd>
								<dt>A button to pop up the stapler plate</dt>
								<dd>
									<li>Assigning a button to this functionality to increase discoverability of this feature</li>
								</dd>
								<dt>An icon to indicate how to rotate the stapler plate to change from inward to outward mode</dt>
								<dd>
									<ul>
										<li>To ensure users understand that to change the mode they need to rotate the plate, we added a red arrow that draws a circle signifying to users a rotation needs to occur to enable the function.</li>
										<img class='imgLarge' src='images/stapler/splate.png'>
									</ul>
								</dd>
								<p>In this iteration we increased discoverability, but had not addressed the issues of safety. Thus, we decided to continue iterating on our prototype. </p>
							</dl>
								
							<h2>Third Iteration:</h2>
							<figure>
								<img class='imgLarge' src='images/stapler/i3.jpg' style="width:100%">
								<figcaption>Prototype 3 focused on safety and improving upon previous ideas.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<br>
							<h3>Key Insights:</h3>
							<dl>
								<dt>Added a button to open the reloading chamber</dt>
								<dd><li>To further help users understand how to activate the function of reloading</li></dd>
								<dt>Decrease the space between the stapler head and metal plate</dt>
								<dd>
								<ul>
									<li>To reduce the possibility of users putting their fingers in or jamming the product, therefore increasing safety. </li>
									<li>Decided to change the space to 3.00mm, which can hold around 20 sheets of paper. Physically restricting users from stapling more than 20 sheets of paper to prevent stapler jams.</li>
									<li>3.00mm is a very small space, making it physically impossible for users to place their finger in between and hurt themselves</li>
								</ul>
								</dd>
							</dl>
							
							<br>
							<h1>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h1>
							<p>To better visualize our redesign, we used Fusion 360 to create a 3D rendering of our third prototype:</p>
							<span class='imgDUAL'><img src="images/stapler/hifi1.gif">‎‎</span>
							<br>
							<span class='imgDUAL'><img src="images/stapler/hifi2.gif"></span>
							<p>We made one change to our prototype. From our interviews we identified that users faced difficulty putting in staples because the space inside the chamber is too small. Thus, we increased the size of the staple chamber to allow for more space to place staples in.</p>
							<br>
							
							<br>
							<h1>Final Product</h1>
							<p>Based on our initial user research and iterations, we completed a redesign of the everyday stapler.</p>
							<br>
							<span class='imgDUAL'><img src="images/stapler/f1.png">‎‎</span>
							<br>
							<p>Similar to any other design, our new redesign also brings about new tradeoffs. Because we decided to increase the reloading chamber space, new kinds of staples would be needed, as the current staples are too small and would not fit. However, we thought this change is necessary and worth the expenditure as looking for more space in the reloading chamber or having difficulty putting staples was a common user problem.	</p>
							<br>
							<p>Another potential tradeoff of the redesign is platform consistency and familiarity, as it is a new-looking stapler with colors and symbols never seen before. So, while we improved discoverability and safety, users may need time to adjust to this new design, as they are used to traditional staplers. But, again, most users were unaware of hidden affordances and functions of traditional staplers. Therefore, we believe this change is important and will eventually contribute to a better experience and lifespan of the product.</p>
							<br>
							<h1>Reflections</h1>
							<p>This project was my first introduction into the world of design. I learned a great deal about user research and human-centered design concepts. The journey of this project was by no means perfect, and I would definitely have stressed the need for more user testing.</p>
							<br>
							<p>In conclusion, if I were to continue working on this project I would:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Further test & refine redesign</li>
								<li>Research the utility and value of the inwards & outwards staple function</li>
								<li>Research different types of materials for body of the stapler, alleviating its weight burden</li>
								<li>Finally, create a physical working prototype</li>
							</ul>
